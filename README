MooseGesture - A mouse gesture recognitiion module for Python.

Released under a "Simplified BSD" license

This game can run with both Python 2 and Python 3. This module is fed a series of XY coordinates (which can come from the mouse or another source) and can recognize when the mouse is moving in one of the eight cardinal or diagonal directions.

These mouse movements can be combined to form "mouse gestures" to perform different commands.

The moosegesturetest.py is a Pygame program that demonstrates how the module works. The blog post at http://coffeeghost.net/2011/05/09/moosegesture-python-mouse-gestures-module/ describes the module in more detail, along with a couple screenshots of the test program.
